* Phonebook is a simple mini project in C++ that can help you understand the basic concepts of functions and file handling. 

*  This application will teach you how to add, list, modify or edit, search and delete data to/from the file. 
 
* Adding new records, listing them, modifying them and updating, search for contacts saved, and deleting the phonebook records 
  are the basic functions which make up the main menu of this Phonebook application. 
 
* text file containging all the records we can Encrypt and Decrypt that file using a key.
 
* I have used many functions in this mini project. 
 
* added a login window user has to enter username and password for accessing and to make any changes in the data. 
 
* used windows library to add some effects and animation to the project to make it look like real.
 
* used window library in many diffrent ways to give effects to it.
